##################################################
# This is THE project that I'm planning to do
# It will combine tools like nmap, mass scan, 
# vulnerability scanner and exploitation tool.
#
# Dante would look something like this
# hehe@home:/$ ./dante-scanner IP 1:1000
# this would scan first 1000 ports on IP 
# during scan, dante will 
# -> fingerprint OS, 
# -> find versions of daemons working on open ports
# -> scrape for explots(if there are any) from etc. explot.db
# -> generate you shellcode from shellstorm for that OS
# 
# After scan you would have links with PoC to exploit that port
# and shellcode to inject to get shell
